# SinkADotCom
A battle ship inspired game from Head First Java: Second Edition, where your goal is to sink the three Dot Coms located on a 7 by 7 grid in the least number of guesses.  The letters A-G cover one side of the grid and the numbers 0-6 cover the other side.  An example guess/tile would be A5.
